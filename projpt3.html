    <p> My interest in football was influenced from a young age as I began playing for my Elementary School. The physicallity and aggressive contact that football provides a player with 
    is something that always has lead me to gain a lot of exciting playmaking abilities. Whenever watching or playing football, the most exciting part is to see a player try his or her
    hardest to make plays happen. That is how tremendous players and plays occur. My interest for football has been also influenced by the NFL and watching players go out every Sunday.
    This influences me and my friends to go out and attempt to make catches and runs that players in reality are able to make.</p>

    <p> The sport of basketball was among the first sports that I learned to play. After dribbling the ball for a couple of minutes and throwing up some wild shots, the basketball became 
    an extension of my body and it became second nature to dribble through my legs, behind the back, pull up SWISH! </p>
