    <p class= "w3-text-white" > Cars are supposed to be another extension of you. They are objects of art that are designed and crafted with precise detail and hard work. Finding your interest in certain designs and engines is what is so cool about cars. It is very interesting to have a passion for cars because they involve so much knowledge about engineering and design. Digging into particular asthetics and engine power is something that is geniunely fun to learn about. After all, cars are things that we see every day, yet the excitement of seeing a rare car is something that would make someone's day. Next are two of my favorite cars.</p>
